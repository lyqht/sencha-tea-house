# Sencha Teahouse

This project is created with the template as such
```
npx react-native init --template react-native-template-typscript
```

This app intends to be a shopping app for buying tea and sweets from Sencha Teahouse. 

It explores the use of: 
- GraphCMS
- Zustand for state management
- Adding Expo-Cli to a RN project that was created bare
  - this can be found in the snack link in the repository
- Async Storage for locally stored items (TODO)
- Supertokens for Auth (TODO, pending RN SDK to be up)
- Some animation library (TODO)

This app is created for some of my [exercise submissions for Centauri React Cohort](https://github.com/lyqht/centauri-react-native).

## Demo

Coming soon!
